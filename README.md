NucleusCore Core is a framework to express and orchestrate business logic in a way that is agnostic to the framework.

## This gem is still very much in development. A `nucleus-rails` gem will handle the adaptation of NucleusCore::View objects to the rails rendering methods.

Here are the classes NucleusCore exposes, they have preordained responsibilities, can be composed together, and tested simply in isolation from the framework.

- Policy (Authorization) - Can this user perform this process?
- Operation (Services) - Executes a single unit of business logic, or side effect (ScheduleAppointment, CancelOrder, UpdateAddress).
- Workflow (Service Orchestration) - Excecutes multiple units of work, and side effects (ApproveLoan, TakePayment, CancelFulfillments).
- View (Presentation) - A presentation object which can render to multiple formats.
- Repository (Data access) - Interacts with data sources to hide the implementation details to callers, and return Aggregates. Data sources could be an API, ActiveRecord, SQL, a local file, etc.
- Aggregate (Domain/business Object) - Maps data from the data source to an object the aplication defines, known as an anti corruption layer.

Below is an example using NucleusCore Core with Rails:

```ruby
# controllers/payments_controller.rb
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    NucleusCore::Responder.handle_response do
      policy.enforce!(:can_write?)

      context, _process = HandleCheckoutWorkflow.call(invoice_params)

      return context if !context.success?

      return PaymentView.new(cart: context.cart, paid: context.paid)
    end
  end

  private

  def policy
    Policy.new(current_user)
  end

  def invoice_params
    params.slice(:cart_id)
  end
end

# workflows/handle_checkout_workflow.rb
class HandleCheckoutWorkflow < NucleusCore::Workflow
  def define
    start_node(continue: :calculate_amount)
    register_node(
      state: :calculate_amount,
      operation: FetchShoppingCart,
      determine_signal: ->(context) { context.cart.total > 10 ? :discount : :pay },
      signals: { discount: :apply_discount, pay: :take_payment }
    )
    register_node(
      state: :apply_discount,
      operation: ApplyDiscountToShoppingCart,
      signals: { continue: :take_payment }
    )
    register_node(
      state: :take_payment,
      operation: ->(context) { context.paid = context.cart.paid },
      determine_signal: ->(_) { :completed }
    )
    register_node(
      state: :completed,
      determine_signal: ->(_) { :wait }
    )
  end
end

    cart = ShoppingCartRepository.find(context.cart_id)

  end
end

# app/repositories/shopping_cart_repository.rb
class ShoppingCartRepository < NucleusCore::Repository
  def self.find(cart_id)
    cart = ShoppingCart.find(cart_id)

    return ShoppingCart::Aggregate.new(cart)
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound => e
    raise NucleusCore::NotFound, e.message
  end

  def self.discount(cart_id, percentage)
    cart = find(cart_id, percentage=0.5)

    cart.update!(total: cart.total * percentage, paid: true)

end

# app/operations/apply_discount_to_shopping_cart.rb
class ApplyDiscountToShoppingCart < NucleusCore::Operation
  def call
    cart = ShoppingCartRepository.discount(context.cart_id, 0.75)

    context.cart
  rescue NucleusCore::NotFound => e
    context.fail!(e.message, exception: e)
  end
end

# app/views/payments_view.rb
class NucleusCore::PaymentView < NucleusCore::View
  def initialize(cart)
    super(total: "$#{cart.total}", paid: cart.paid, created_at: cart.created_at)
  end

  def json_response
    content = {
      payment: {
        price: price,
        paid: paid,
        created_at: created_at,
        signature: SecureRandom.hex
      }
    }

    NucleusCore::JsonResponse.new(content: content)
  end

  def pdf_response
    pdf_string = generate_pdf_string(price, paid)

    NucleusCore::PdfResponse.new(content: pdf_string)
  end

  private def generate_pdf_string(price, paid)
    # pdf string genration...
