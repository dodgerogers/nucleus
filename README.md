Nucleus is an optionated framework of components that aim to provide a way to express the business logic of your application without being tied to your framework.

Below is a trivial example of what using Nucleus would look like using Rails:

```ruby
class PaymentsController
  def create
    Nucleus::Responder.handle_response do
      Policy.new(current_user).enforce!(:can_write?)

      invoice_params = params.slice(:price)
      context, _process = HandlePaymentWorkflow.call(invoice_params)

      if context.success?
        return PaymentView.new(price: context.price, paid: context.paid)
      else
        return context
      end
    end
  end
end

class CalculateAmount < Nucleus::Operation
  def call
    context.price = rand(1..12)
  end
end

class ApplyDiscount < Nucleus::Operation
  def call
    context.price = context.price * 0.75
  end
end

class HandlePaymentWorkflow < Nucleus::Workflow
  def define
    start_node(continue: :calculate_amount)
    register_node(
      state: :calculate_amount,
      operation: CalculateAmount
      determine_signal: ->(context) { context.price > 10 ? :discount : :pay }
      signals: { discount: :apply_discount, pay: :take_payment }
    )
    register_node(
      state: :apply_discount,
      operation: ApplyDiscount,
      signals: { continue: :take_payment }
    )
    register_node(
      state: :take_payment,
      operation: ->(context) { context.paid = true },
      determine_signal: ->(_) { :completed }
    )
    register_node(
      state: :completed,
      determine_signal: ->(_) { :wait }
    )
  end
end

class Nucleus::PaymentView < Nucleus::View
  def initialize(attrs={})
    super(price: attrs[:price], paid: attrs[:paid])
  end

  def json_response
    content = { { payment: { price: price, paid: paid } } }

    Nucleus::JsonResponse.new(content: content)
  end

  def pdf_response
    pdf_string = generate_pdf_string(price, paid)

    Nucleus::PdfResponse.new(content: pdf_string)
  end
end
```

Nucleus provides the following classes with the respective resonsibilities, so business cases can be orchestrated, expressed consistently, and tested without worrying about framework concerns.

- Policy (Authorization) - can this user perform this process?
- Operation (Service class) - Execute a single unit of business logic (ScheduleAppointment, CancelOrder, UpdateAddress)
- Workflow (Service orchestration) - Orchestrate a complex business workflow using Operations (ApproveLoan, TakePayment, CancelFulfillments)
- View (Presentation) - A presentation object to be adapted to multiple output formats (OrderView, CustomerView)
- Repository (Data aceccess) - Handles interactions with a data source where and however it is stored, such that callers are unaware to the implementation details, but are returned an object the application owns and defines (see Aggregates) below. External data sources could be: an external API, ActiveRecord, a file, etc...
- Aggregate (Domain/business Object) - An object returned from repositories such that changes to the external data schema do not flow into the app unknowingly.
